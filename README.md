A simple standalone pure-python Tkinter framework.

**NOTE:** It has nothing to do with `tkinter.ttk`, just the `tkinter` module.

## Features
### Window

### Widgets
- Label
- Button
- Entry
- Text area

    - Virtualized scrollable.

## Documentation
- No plans for now but the code is quite _self-documenting_.
